Load all data at once:

1) Open a terminal in the project folder "HU_HONto" (it is important to do this and to stay here for the scripts to run properly)

2) Make sure you followed the steps of the install_neo4j documentation, such that neo4j is running

3) python ./load_all_data.py

4) Explore the data in your neo4j browser using the cypher query language, e.g. http://localhost:7474/browser/


OR run the scripts step by step:

1) Open a terminal in the project folder "HU_HONto" (it is important to do this and to stay here for the scripts to run properly)

2) Make sure you followed the steps of the install_neo4j documentation, such that neo4j is running

3) python ./scripts/load_gg.py 

4) python ./scripts/load_bverfge.py 

Step 4) may take a while (estimate: 30 min).

5) python ./scripts/load_names.py 

6) python ./scripts/load_textbooks.py 

Steps 4) and 6) may take a while because many attribute comparisons are performed and potential relationships are created.

7) Explore the data in your neo4j browser using the cypher query language, e.g. http://localhost:7474/browser/
